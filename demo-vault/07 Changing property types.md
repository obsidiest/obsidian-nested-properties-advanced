# Changing property types

Right-click any nested key and open the **Property type** submenu to convert a value to another type - text, number, checkbox, date, list, object, and even **Tags**. Converting a rich value to a simpler one can lose data, so Nested Properties Advanced shows a confirmation dialog first. The chosen type is **saved** to the vault's `.obsidian/types.json` under the property's dotted path, so it survives a reload.

## Try it

1. Right-click `countAsText`, choose **Property type -> Number**; the string `"42"` becomes the number `42`.
2. Right-click `enabledAsText`, choose **Property type -> Checkbox**; `"true"` becomes a real boolean.
3. Right-click `apiConfig` (an object), choose **Property type -> Text**. Because that would flatten an object into a string, a **Display as text?** confirmation appears - confirm or cancel.
4. Expand `apiConfig`, right-click `labels`, and choose **Property type -> Tags** - a type Obsidian's own UI won't let you assign. Reload the vault and the choice sticks.
5. Expand a `releases` item and right-click `released`. Use **Property type (all items) -> Date** to type that field for every release at once, or **Property type (this item only)** to override a single one.

## Start over

This is the one walkthrough here that accumulates: each conversion rewrites this note's own frontmatter **and** records the chosen type, which - as step 4 points out - survives a reload. So trying step 3 a second time would otherwise start from the already-converted value.

```code-button
---
caption: Reset this note's properties and forget the saved types
---
await require('/demoSetup.ts').resetPropertyTypesDemo(app);
```

Manual equivalent: restore this note's frontmatter by hand, and reset each property's type back to the one Obsidian infers. Only the types this note's own keys use are forgotten - anything you set elsewhere is untouched.
