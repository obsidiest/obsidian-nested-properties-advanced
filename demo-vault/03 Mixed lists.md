# Mixed lists

When every item in an array is the same simple type, Nested Properties Advanced shows it as a normal **list**. When the items are of **mixed** types (text, number, boolean, nested object, nested array), it shows a **Mixed list** widget instead, so each item keeps its own type and stays editable.

## Look at the Properties panel

1. `simpleList` is all strings - a plain list.
2. `mixedList` mixes a string, a number, a boolean, an object, and an array - a **Mixed list**, with a type icon per item.
