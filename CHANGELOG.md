# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.0

- fix: cancel Live Preview root-key drafts against the current metadata entry so Escape preserves an Enter-committed rename after metadata refresh
- fix: share Source mapping-key boundaries so apostrophes in plain property names retain guides, threading, and hover activation
- fix: measure expanded parent key hover regions independently of child containers positioned below them
- feat: single-click breadcrumb navigation places the caret at the key end in Live Preview and Source, with hover previews independent of keyboard focus
- feat: use descriptive per-mode hover breadcrumb timeout labels and default all four numerical values to 0.01 seconds while preserving saved values

- feat: add searchable global and per-mode hover breadcrumb timeout controls with precise decimal-second inputs and individual override precedence
- fix: activate Source-mode leaf and parent fold gutters independently of full-field and full-key activation toggles
- fix: preserve the current breadcrumb across the pointer-travel gap and apply one dismissal timer to ordinary field and popover exits

- fix: bind Live Preview metadata hit testing directly to every Properties editor and isolate Source hit testing to its owning CodeMirror view so full-row threading and exact breadcrumb scopes activate and deactivate reliably
- fix: keep captured Live Preview property redo state through the metadata rerender after Ctrl+Z, preserve editor scroll in both editing modes, and confine breadcrumb scrolling to the popover itself

- fix: bind property hover hit testing to the complete Markdown source-view and select Live Preview metadata rows solely by vertical position across the editor viewport
- fix: keep key-only and icon-only hover breadcrumbs scoped to their exact targets while preserving the interactive popover handoff delay
- fix: resolve Source root and flattened property rows through the EditorView that delivered the pointer event, excluding stale virtualized lines from other tabs or editor views
- fix: replace the escaped Live Preview Properties history fallback with exact, non-history CodeMirror undo/redo transactions that neither move the selection nor intercept Source-mode history
- breaking: rename the plugin, manifest ID, command namespace, release assets, and installation folder to Nested Properties Advanced (`nested-properties-advanced`)
- fix: register a CodeMirror view plugin for exact virtualized-line mapping, viewport updates, and `scrollDOM` repaint scheduling instead of cursor-nearest Source-line inference
- fix: attach row-based pointer listeners directly to every rendered metadata container so full-field, full-key, and icon activation do not depend on Obsidian's bubbled event target
- fix: arm the Live Preview property transaction when Escape is pressed even when Obsidian retains focus in its property input, allowing Ctrl+Y to replay the exact Ctrl+Z edit
- fix: bind Source guide overlays to the current editor viewport, hide stale geometry during scroll, and rerender from the newly visible CodeMirror lines
- fix: clear Source-owned guides, threading, highlights, breadcrumbs, and cached Live Preview geometry whenever an editor changes mode
- fix: observe pointer movement in the capture phase so Obsidian editor internals cannot suppress full-key/full-field breadcrumb and threading activation
- fix: preserve the completed Live Preview property transaction at Ctrl+Z, then restore Ctrl+Y after Escape by replaying it only when both native redo paths remain unchanged
- fix: use geometric property-row hit testing so threading and hover-breadcrumb scopes cover their configured full widths
- fix: map Source-mode hover targets through editor coordinates so root, flattened, repeated, and nested fields resolve reliably
- fix: suppress the native ancestor-tree focus background while Highlight Active Property Field Tree is disabled
- feat: add default-enabled Live Preview, Source, and Reading-mode visibility switches for main-UI property threading and static tree indentation guides
- feat: render static guides and active property threading alongside raw Source-mode frontmatter
- feat: wrap complete hover-breadcrumb property names by default behind a searchable expansion switch
- fix: widen the default hover breadcrumb and inset its root guide so long names wrap legibly and the top-level spine is not clipped
- feat: add separate themed Style Settings controls for active-tree background and outline colors, with neutral gray and black defaults
- fix: make nested object keys editable in Live Preview while keeping structural array indices read-only
- fix: activate property threading across the full property key/value row, including Source-mode root and flattened fields
- feat: add selectable full-field, full-key, and icon/expansion-toggle hover-breadcrumb activation scopes
- fix: disambiguate repeated Source-mode YAML keys by their visible editor line so breadcrumbs retain the complete ancestry
- fix: render enabled static guides and threading above hover-breadcrumb rows
- feat: remember per-note Expand/Collapse All Nested Properties and full-key-name states across restarts
- feat: add global and per-note controls for nested-property expansion and full key names, including disabled header-button states
- feat: rename the full-key header action dynamically to Expand Full Key Names or Collapse Full Key Names
- feat: add optional active property-tree highlighting with Style Settings controls
- fix: render property visuals only after layout readiness and only for shown metadata editors, reusing unchanged tab renders and invalidating only the editor that changed
- fix: build guide overlays off-DOM, prune collapsed descendants, cache computed Style Settings values, and batch expand/collapse-all redraws
- fix: keep Style Settings precision controls dormant while their section is closed and remove the synchronous whole-workspace Style Settings parse during startup
- fix: isolate property visuals and Style Settings observers from unrelated Live Preview DOM churn
- fix: mirror fresh production `main.js` and `styles.css` artifacts to the repository root for flat-layout local deployment scripts
- feat: add searchable settings for property hover breadcrumbs, static tree guides, and property-field threading
- feat: add clickable, keyboard-navigable property ancestry breadcrumbs in Live Preview, Source, and Reading modes
- feat: add main-UI and breadcrumb tree guides with active-path, all-branch, root-level, and cursor-activated threading modes
- feat: add comprehensive Style Settings controls with synchronized precise numeric inputs and themed thread colors
- test: cover property trees, source frontmatter parsing, breadcrumb navigation, guide geometry, settings defaults, and release configuration
- build: attest every published release asset with GitHub artifact attestations
